Motorized sunshade using a Raspberry Pi

I have an office in my basement with one window that allows sunlight into the room.  In my office, I have some houseplants and fish tanks that enjoy the sunlight.  In addition, during the day, it is difficult for passers-by to see through the window, while at night, it is a beaming globe that is viewable easily from a distance.  Therefore, there was a need for a pull-down shade to operate automatically, timed with the sun, both for security and light enhancement.  The primary components of the project are a Raspberry Pi, 3D printed parts, a stepper motor, and a cheap sunshade from Lowes.
